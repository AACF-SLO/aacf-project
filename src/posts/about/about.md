verse: "''I am the vine; you are the branches. Whoever abides in me and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing.''"
fall: "We love because He first loved us. Understanding God’s love is foundational for us to reflect and overflow His love onto others and to pursue other spiritual gifts and virtues God has given to us. As we understand the sheer magnitude of His amazing love and how undeserving of it we are, we naturally become inclined to show others that same love"
winter: "We have the fullness of joy in God’s presence because of the reality of the Gospel. Joy is an internal condition that leads us to live our lives as worship regardless of circumstance. This internal condition is a result of our understanding of who Jesus is and our trust in His unfailing promises"
spring: "We recognize that the lives that God desires us to have are far greater than the lives we desire for ourselves. Therefore our lives are no longer our own, but we surrender them to Christ. The end of kingdom living is not simply self-denial. Rather we deny ourselves and surrender to God because we recognize how worthy He is."
