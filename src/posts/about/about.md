verse: "''This is how we know what love is: Jesus Christ laid down his life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers and sisters.''"
fall: "We want to dedicate this quarter to the “why” of our “how” in order to lay a strong foundation for our knowledge of the Gospel. Our understanding and acceptance of
the Gospel is a prerequisite to genuinely love one another. We must recognize the foundational truths laid out in the Bible."
winter: "A lot of people are stuck at home, so it’s harder to have a physical sense of loving one another. However, this shouldn’t stop us
from laying down our lives for our brother and sisters in anyway that we can. We need to make sure that our faith put into actions
isn’t growing cold because of the physical distances."
spring: "The Church is the bride of Christ. It’s
important to be a part of the church and not just a fellowship. For most of us, the fellowship is only during our college years, and so
we believe it’s important to highlight the importance of church involvement so that it would carry over to post graduation."
fallWords: "...what the Gospel means."
winterWords: "...to love those around us."
springWords: "...to be involved in the Church."
