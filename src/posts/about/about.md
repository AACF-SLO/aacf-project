verse: "Teach me your way, O Lord, that I may walk in your truth; unite my heart to fear your name. Psalms 86:11 (ESV)"
fall: "UNDERSTAND. During the first quarter of the year, we want to define what having an Undivided heart means and looks
like. By giving a foundation and background of who God is, we can better understand why He deserves
our entire lives."
winter: "REFLECT. During the second quarter, we will take time to look back on how good and faithful God has been in our
lives and explore how much God loves us. As we reflect on Godâ€™s love, it can help shift our perception of
our relationship with Him from obligation to desire. Our testimonies are powerful and should be used to
encourage others. (Revelations 12:11)"
spring: "OVERFLOW. During the third quarter, we will put all we have learned into action. After we establish a personal
relationship with God, fellowship with other believers and evangelizing to non-believers should naturally
flow out of it. As we are filled up with the love of Christ, that love should overflow into those around us."
