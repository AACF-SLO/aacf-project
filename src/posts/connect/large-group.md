Each week starts off with icebreakers and a time of worship, followed by a message related to the quarterly subtheme delivered by a speaker.  We also have Post Large Groups where brothers and sisters can get to know each other more through hangouts, conversation, and/or food. Large groups are on Friday nights at 7:30!"
