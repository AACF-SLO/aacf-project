title: "Large Group"
category: "Connect"
description: "Large Groups are weekly meetings currently held through Zoom where the body of AACF gathers in a time of fellowship. Each week starts off with icebreakers and a time of worship, usually followed by a message related to the quarterly subtheme delivered by a speaker. However, we also plan to do other activities for certain weeks. We also have Post Large Groups where brothers and sisters can get to know each other more through hangouts, conversation, and/or games. This is a great place to meet a lot of
people in the fellowship in a larger group setting."
