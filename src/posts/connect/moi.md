description: "MOI stand for “Moment of Impact.” A MOI is a one on one with someone to have intentional conversations. It can just be to get to know someone better over a meal or activity, to share testimonies, or to check up on someone spiritually. It can be as casual or serious as you two want it to be. You can ask anyone in the fellowship to MOI in person (postponed indefinitely) or through video or phone call, or sign up to be paired with someone."
who: "Everyone. Feel free to ask anyone to MOI :)"
