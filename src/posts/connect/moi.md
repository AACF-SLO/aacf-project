description: "MOIs stand for “Moment of Impact.” A MOI is a one on one with someone to have intentional conversations. It can be just to get to know someone better over a meal, to share testimonies or check up on someone spiritually. You can ask anyone in the fellowship to MOI in person, or sign up to be paired with someone."
